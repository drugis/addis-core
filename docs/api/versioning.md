title: Versioning mechanism
---

Defines a mechanism for versioning of RDF datasets, which are collections of graphs.
This serves as a back-end to the datasets offered through the Trialverse API.
It is less specific and constrained in a number of ways.
Specifically, it is not concerned with authentication or authorization and will execute any request given to it, as long as it is a valid request.

Data model
----------

The data model is described in RDF, using a vocabulary under the prefix `http://drugis.org/eventSourcing/es#`, abbreviated as `es:`.
Use is also made of Dublin Core Terms, abbreviated as `dcterms:`.
All datasets served by the event sourcing RDF store are stored in a single underlying RDF dataset.
The meta-data are stored in the default graph, and named graphs are used to store differences between graph versions.

Datasets match the following pattern:

```turtle
?dataset a es:Dataset ;
  dcterms:date ?creationDate ;
  dcterms:creator ?creatorUri ;
  es:head ?version .
```

Of these triples, only the `?dataset es:head ?version` triple will ever change.
The `?creatorUri` has no specific meaning to the event sourcing system, but is assumed to be meaningful to the client.
The `?version` is further defined as:

```turtle
?version a es:DatasetVersion ;
  dcterms:date ?versionDate ;
  dcterms:creator ?creatorUri ;
  es:dataset ?dataset .
```

Here, the `es:dataset` predicate identifies the dataset for which this version was originally created. Most versions will also point to their predecessor using

```turtle
?version es:previous ?previousVersion .
```

Each version enumerates the graphs it contains, by pointing to specific graph revisions:

```turtle
?version es:graph_revision [
    es:graph ?graphUri ;
    es:revision ?revision .
  ] .
```

```turtle
?version es:default_graph_revision [
    es:revision ?revision .
  ] .
```

A revision is a changeset applied to a single graph, and is represented as follows:

```turtle
?revision a es:Revision ;
  es:version ?version ;
  es:previous ?previousRevision ;
  es:assertions ?assertionsGraph ;
  es:retractions ?retractionsGraph .
```

A version refers to a revision of each graph it contains, but a revision also refers to a specific version.
This allows the same revision of a graph to be referred to in different versions of a dataset, or in different datasets, while still uniquely identifying the event in which the revision was created.
For example, this enables a use case like the following:

```
 --o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---------   graph G (dataset A)
            \                   \
             o-------------------o---o---   graph H (dataset B)
```

Here, dataset B adopts a specific revision of the graph of interest from dataset A.
After some time, the maintainer of dataset B decides to update his revision of the graph to the latest one, and he subsequently makes changes of his own.
Here, all but the last revision of the graph are credited to versions of dataset A, while the last revision is credited to a version of dataset B.
Because the first and second versions of dataset B refer to revisions of the graph that do not belong to dataset B, these changes can be displayed differently, e.g. as "Graph H taken from version X of dataset A".
This could enable two views of the history of an individual graph: the history within the specific dataset, and the linear history as recorded by the series of revisions.
Also note that no meta-data is recorded on revisions, as these are stored on the associated version.

The contents of a dataset version can be constructed by constructing the contents of each revision.
These, in turn, can be constructed by replaying the series of changesets given by the `es:previous` property on each revision, from oldest to newest.

URIs for datasets, versions, revisions, assertions, and retractions are generated by the event sourcing store, and are expected to resolve properly, as described below.

### Merging

Merging of changes made to different datasets will not be supported directly by the event sourcing store, but can be indicated in meta-data for specific commits.
For example, when a dataset is initially created as a copy of another dataset, its meta-data would make use of the `es:merged` property to indicate the copied version.
This is an especially simple type of merge, which we indicate using `?version es:mergeType es:MergeCopyTheirs`.

These semantics will be extended in future versions to allow for other merge strategies and to enable the client to specify merge meta-data.

Algorithm for changesets
------------------------

Interaction through the SPARQL graph store or the SPARQL protocol endpoints may alter the contents of a graph. If G is the graph prior to these changes and H is the graph after, then we define the additions A = H - G and the retractions R = G - H. A changeset then is the pair (A, R). To apply a changeset (A, R) to a graph G, compute H = (G - R) ∪ A. To clarify, '-' refers to the set difference of triples contained in each graph, and '∪' to union of the sets of triples.

When transferred over HTTP, changesets will be serialized using [TurtlePatch](http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/TurtlePatch), a strict subset of SPARQL that represents the additions/retractions model, and is also very close to plain Turtle (See [LDP PATCH proposals](http://www.w3.org/2012/ldp/wiki/LDP_PATCH_Proposals) for alternatives).

If an interaction alters one or more graphs, then the above algorithm is used to compute changesets for each graph. A new revision of each such graph is created, and a new version of the dataset is instantiated that refers to the new revisions for those graphs, and to existing revisions of all other graphs. An exception is when a graph is explicitly deleted (using the HTTP DELETE method), or when all triples in a graph are deleted. In that case, the new version of the dataset will not make reference to that graph. In case a new graph is created (explicilty through an HTTP POST of graph content, or implicitly through a SPARQL query), this will be represented through a graph revision with no `es:previous`.

Blank nodes are handled using skolemization ([W3C guidance](http://www.w3.org/2011/rdf-wg/wiki/Skolemization), [discussion](http://answers.semanticweb.com/questions/8336/what-is-skolemization)), i.e. replacing blank nodes (which are essentially existential operators) with specific instances (URIs). 
Skolemization is important to ensure that changesets containing blank nodes are unambiguous even if they are transferred between systems.
Skolem URIs must be "fresh" (globally unique) and they must be recognizable as skolems, so they can be mapped back to blank nodes if necessary.
Freshness is achieved by generating 128-bit [Flake](https://github.com/boundary/flake) IDs, and a recognizable URI is derived by appending a [Base 64 Encoding with URL and Filename Safe Alphabet](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648) without padding to the `/.well-known/skolem/` prefix.
Note that skolemization must happen before changesets are calculated, and that if clients create new blank nodes, they must retrieve the updated graph to learn the skolem URIs of those blank nodes.

TODO: should there be a route for de-skolemized versions of graphs?
Other solutions to blank nodes in changesets are possible, but complicate the way differences are computed - they are NP-complete.

Creating datasets
-----------------

A new dataset is created though a POST request to /datasets.
The request body should be empty.
The X-EventSource-Creator header can be used to specify a URI identifying the author.

```http
POST /datasets HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
X-EventSource-Creator: http://example.com/GreenGoblin
X-EventSource-Title: SW5pdGlhbCB2ZXJzaW9u
```

This will result in a `201 Created` response indicating both the location of the new dataset and the initial version ID.

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: http://example.com/datasets/ubb245f8sz
X-EventSource-Version: http://example.com/versions/3ucq3j5c7u
```

A special route is available for copying (cloning) datasets:

```http
POST /datasets?copyOf=http://example.com/versions/7wi4xglx1c HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
X-EventSource-Creator: http://example.com/PeterParker
X-EventSource-Title: Q29weSBHcmVlbkdvYmxpbi9TcGlkZXJtYW4=
```

The response contract is identical, but in this case special meta-data will be attached to the initial version of this dataset to indicate it is a copy of another dataset.

Updating and querying datasets
------------------------------

Under `/datasets/:dataset-id` reside a SPARQL protocol query (`./query`) and update (`./update`) endpoint, as well as a SPARQL graph store (`./data`) using the indirect graph identification pattern.
The protocol is modified in three ways:

 1. All requests can specify the `X-Accept-EventSource-Version` header, and the server will `Vary: X-Accept-EventSource-Version`.
For requests that do not alter the state (i.e. requests to the query endpoint and `GET` requests to the graph store), the header indicates that the contents of a previous version are being queried.
For requests that do alter state, the header indicates that the requests expects the latest version to be the version specified in the header.
If it is not, the request fails with a `409 Conflict` response.
If the header is not specified, the action is executed against the latest version.

 2. All write requests can specify the `X-EventSource-Creator` header to set the creator attribute of the new version, and `X-EventSource-Title` and `X-EventSource-Description` to provide a short and long description respectively. The `X-EventSource-Title` and `X-EventSource-Description` headers must be encoded in UTF-8 using [Base 64 Encoding](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648).

 3. All requests return a `X-EventSource-Version` header. For read requests this indicates the version being returned, while for write requests it indicates the new version created.

TODO: should (some of) the request headers be mandatory?

Copying of graphs is supported on the graph store route, using the copyOf parameter:

```http
POST /datasets/:dataset-id/data?graph=:graphUri&copyOf=:revision HTTP/1.1
```

Similarly to copying of datasets, this is represented in event meta-data through the `es:merged` and `es:mergeType` predicates.

Investigating history
---------------------

```http
GET /datasets/:dataset-id HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

Should return the full history for the given dataset, including the dataset definition itself.
In particular, this can be resolved using the following SPARQL query (where `$dataset` needs to be replaced):

```sparql
PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
PREFIX es: <http://drugis.org/eventSourcing/es#>

CONSTRUCT {
 ?s ?p ?o
} WHERE {
  $dataset owl:sameAs{0} ?dataset .

  ?dataset es:head ?head .
  ?head es:previous* ?version .
  ?version es:merged ?mergedVersion .
  {
    ?version es:graph_revision ?graphRev .
  } UNION {
    ?version es:default_graph_revision ?graphRev .
  }
  ?graphRev es:revision/es:previous* ?revision .
  ?revision es:version ?referencedVersion .

  {
    ?dataset owl:sameAs{0} ?s .
  } UNION {
    ?version owl:sameAs{0} ?s .
  } UNION {
    ?mergedVersion owl:sameAs{0} ?s .
  } UNION {
    ?graphRev owl:sameAs{0} ?s .
  } UNION {
    ?revision owl:sameAs{0} ?s .
  } UNION {
    ?referencedVersion owl:sameAs{0} ?s .
  }

  ?s ?p ?o .
}
```

Each version will return a description of itself, including any revisions and the dataset.
Each revision will return its contents. TODO: viewing history of a revision? TODO: retrieving TurtlePatch?
Each assertions and retractions will return its contents.

More complicated queries regarding history can be answered by the `/query` SPARQL protocol endpoint, which exposes the underlying dataset as is.

Example
-------

Note: this example uses a variety of different ID generation schemes.
IDs as shown here should not be seen as indicative of the actual ID generation scheme to be used.

Say the Green Goblin creates a dataset to state that, in fact, Peter Parker goes by the names "Peter Parker" and "Spiderman".

To do this, we first create the new dataset:

```http
POST /datasets HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
X-EventSource-Creator: http://example.com/GreenGoblin
X-EventSource-Title: SW5pdGlhbCB2ZXJzaW9u
```

And the server responds with a newly created dataset, and indicates the initial version ID:

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: http://example.com/datasets/ubb245f8sz
X-EventSource-Version: http://example.com/versions/3ucq3j5c7u
```

After this, the triple store looks like:

```turtle
@prefix dcterms:   <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/> .
@prefix xsd:  <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .
@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .

@prefix es: <http://drugis.org/eventSourcing/es#> .
@prefix dataset: <http://example.com/datasets/> .

dataset:ubb245f8sz a es:Dataset ;
  dcterms:date "2014-09-24T12:40:03+0000"^^xsd:dateTime ;
  dcterms:creator <http://example.com/GreenGoblin> ;
  es:head version:3ucq3j5c7u .

version:3ucq3j5c7u a es:DatasetVersion ;
  dcterms:date "2014-09-24T12:40:03+0000"^^xsd:dateTime ;
  dcterms:creator <http://example.com/GreenGoblin> ;
  dcterms:title "Initial version" .
```

Then, we post new contents for the graph describing Peter Parker:

```http
POST /datasets/ubb245f8sz/data?graph=http://example.com/PeterParker HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: text/turtle
X-EventSource-Creator: http://example.com/GreenGoblin
X-EventSource-Title: UGV0ZXIgUGFya2VyIGlzIFNwaWRlcm1hbg==
X-EventSource-Description: SXQgaXMgdGltZSB0aGUgd29ybGQga25ldy4uLg0KVGhhdCBQZXRlciBQYXJrZXIgaXMgU3BpZGVybWFuIQ==
X-Accept-EventSource-Version: http://example.com/versions/3ucq3j5c7u

@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .

<http://example.com/PeterParker> a foaf:Person ;
  foaf:name "Peter Parker", "Spiderman" .
```

The response has no content, and contains a header indicating the created version:

```http
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
X-EventSource-Version: http://example.com/versions/7wi4xglx1c
```

Now, Peter Parker wants to dispute this claim made by the Green Goblin, and starts by creating a copy of his dataset:

```http
POST /datasets?copyOf=http://example.com/versions/7wi4xglx1c HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
X-EventSource-Creator: http://example.com/PeterParker
X-EventSource-Title: Q29weSBHcmVlbkdvYmxpbi9TcGlkZXJtYW4=
```

Notice that no title or description are provided, because no new version is created.
The response, again, indicates the location and version of the newly created dataset:

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: http://example.com/datasets/qmk2x16nz1
X-EventSource-Version: http://example.com/versions/f98gj2sgsn
```

Then Peter procedes to run a SPARQL update query to set the record straight:

```http
POST /datasets/qmk2x16nz1/update HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/sparql-query
X-EventSource-Creator: http://example.com/PeterParker
X-EventSource-Title: VGhlIEdyZWVuIEdvYmxpbiBpcyBhIGxpYXIh
X-Accept-EventSource-Version: http://example.com/versions/7wi4xglx1c

PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>

DELETE DATA {
  GRAPH <http://example.com/PeterParker> {
    <http://example.com/PeterParker> foaf:name "Spiderman"
  }
};
INSERT DATA {
  GRAPH <http://example.com/Spiderman> {
    <http://example.com/Spiderman> a foaf:Person ;
      foaf:name "Spiderman" .
  }
  GRAPH <http://example.com/PeterParker> {
    <http://example.com/PeterParker> foaf:homepage <http://www.okcupid.com/profile/PeterParker> .
  }
}
```

Which results in a newly created version:

```http
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
X-EventSource-Version: http://example.com/versions/g05ri5qvvq
```
